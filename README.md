Hello!

My name is Neel Chudasama and this is my project conducting Data Wrangling and EDA on a Mosquito Dataset.

In this project, I use python clean the dataframe and explore the data to gain insights. The goal of this task was to clean the data and gain a higher level of understanding of West Nile Virus (WNV).

The files in this folder are:

1. Data.csv - This contains the data on Mosquitoes and the traps they were caught in. 
2. Data Wrangling and EDA.ipynb - This jupyter notebook contains all the commands which helped me to clean, manipulate and visualise the data.
3. utils.py - This .py file contains all the customised functions I have collated together.
